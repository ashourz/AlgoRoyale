# Trading Strategy Framework

This project implements a modular, extensible framework for designing, testing, and optimizing multiple trading strategies.

---

## Project Structure

Each trading strategy follows a standard structure based on a common interface. This allows easy addition of new strategies and consistent backtesting.

```python
class Strategy:
    def generate_signals(self, historical_data):
        """
        Given historical price data, return a list of trading signals:
        'buy', 'sell', or 'hold'.
        """
        pass
```

Each individual strategy (e.g., Momentum, Mean Reversion, Moving Average) inherits from `Strategy` and implements its own `generate_signals` method.

## Workflow Overview

| Phase     | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Build     | Implement base `Strategy` class and a simple initial strategy (e.g., Moving Average) |
| Expand    | Add additional strategies (Momentum, Mean Reversion, Moving Average Crossover) |
| Test      | Backtest each strategy using historical data |
| Tune      | Optimize strategy parameters for maximum performance |
| Combine   | Optionally blend multiple strategies for more robust trading |

---

## Strategies to Implement

- **Moving Average Strategy**  
  Buy when the current price is above a moving average; sell when it is below.

- **Momentum Strategy**  
  Buy assets showing strong recent gains; sell those showing weakness.

- **Mean Reversion Strategy**  
  Buy assets that have fallen significantly below their historical average, expecting a bounce back.

- **Moving Average Crossover Strategy**  
  Buy when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average (golden cross).  
  Sell when the short-term crosses below the long-term (death cross).

---

## Backtesting

A backtesting engine simulates each strategy against historical data to evaluate:

- Total returns
- Maximum drawdown
- Win/loss ratio
- Sharpe ratio (risk-adjusted returns)

---

## Optimization

Each strategy can be tuned by optimizing its parameters:

- Moving average window sizes (e.g., 10-day vs. 50-day)
- Momentum thresholds
- Mean reversion trigger points
- Crossover short-term and long-term periods

Search methods like grid search or random search will find the best configurations.

---

## Vision

The final system will allow:

- Easy swapping and testing of different strategies
- Fine-tuned parameter optimization
- Combining strategies into a diversified portfolio

---

## Example Usage (Planned)

```python
# 1. Select a strategy
strategy = MovingAverageStrategy(window=20)

# 2. Generate signals
signals = strategy.generate_signals(historical_data)

# 3. Backtest performance
results = backtest(strategy, historical_data)

# 4. Optimize strategy parameters
best_params = optimize(strategy, param_grid, historical_data)
```

> Note: Start simple with a basic working strategy and backtest. Then gradually add more strategies, tune parameters, and improve performance.
